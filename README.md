# üè´Introduction
This is a Roblox implementation of a simple State Machine! I personally hate the concept of over engineering things so instead I kept it simple and easy to use as all things should be! But in case you are wondering.. what is a State Machine?

A state machine is a way of organizing and controlling the behavior of objects in a program. It's like a flowchart that defines the different states an object can be in and the transitions between those states.

In game development, state machines are often used to manage the behavior of characters, enemies, and other objects in the game world. For example, a state machine might define the states "idle," "walking," "running," and "attacking" for a player character. When the player presses a button to move, the state machine would transition the character from the "idle" state to the "walking" state, and then to the "running" state if the player holds down the movement button for a longer period of time.

State machines can help make game development more efficient and easier to manage by providing a clear structure for controlling the behavior of objects. They also make it easier to add new states and transitions as the game evolves and new features are added.
# üìÅInstallation
There are 3 different ways of installing this package into your project! You can either download it from the releases page, download the Roblox model or install it via Wally!

# üìô Tutorial
Please make sure you've installed the RobloxStateMachine before you decide to jump into the tutorial!

In this tutorial we will be going step by step on how to setup a very simple state machine. We will see how to create states, transitions and then a state machine!

## 1. Organization
Remember, the main purpose we use State Machines to begin with is so we can break down a complex system into smaller and simpler systems! So organisation is key. I Will be showing how I personally like to organise my State Machines. Obviously you can do it however you please yet I'd still highly recommend you to do it this way!

### A. First Create 2 folders
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1105650053118431342/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_01.18.06.png)
We will be using 1 folder to group the states and the second one to group the transitions! Now let's start by making 2 states and 2 transitions.

### B. Create 2 ModuleScripts in each folder as the following example

In this example we will be creating a state machine that manages the color of a part! it will have 2 states: a red and a blue colour.
So we want two states: Blue and Red. We also want to make 2 transitions that will allow us to go from blue to red and from red to blue!

### C. Create a Part and call it "myPart"
We will be creating a part in the workspace and use it as an example to how we can make/use the StateMachine


## 2. States
Now that we organised our files let's setup the states first! We will start by making a simple state template inside of the Blue file!

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local RobloxStateMachine = require(ReplicatedStorage.RobloxStateMachine)

local Blue = RobloxStateMachine.State.new("Blue") -- The name of our state

return Blue
```
This creates and returns a state called Blue. Now let's make it change the colour of our part to blue when it enters this state. Let's also print all lifecycles to have an idea of what is going on!

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local RobloxStateMachine = require(ReplicatedStorage.RobloxStateMachine)

local Blue = RobloxStateMachine.State.new("Blue") -- The name of our state

function Blue:OnInit()
	print("Blue Init!")
end

function Blue:OnEnter(data)
	print("Blue Enter!")
	data.part.Color = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255) -- Change color to blue!
end

function Blue:OnHearBeat()

end

function Blue:OnLeave()
	print("Blue Leave!")
end

return Blue
```
This will turn our part blue when it enters the blue state! Are you confused about where the "data.part" comes from? Don't worry, we're getting right into that next!

## 3. Create State Machine
Now that we have 1 state we can already make our state machine! Don't worry, we will be covering transitions and making our red state next! Now in a server or local script create a state machine with the following code...
